# Crypto Math

One innovation of the modern era of cryptography is to subject cryptosystems to rigorous mathematical analysis in order to prove their security. To achieve this, cryptographers use methods from various branches of math including _Number Theory_, _Probability Theory_, and _Complexity Theory_. In this section, Iâ€™ll cover the math concepts which are needed to understand the topics and applications contained throughout this tutorial.
